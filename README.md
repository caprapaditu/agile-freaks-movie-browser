## Written in Swift and used SwiftUI

This sample is written in Swift and I've used SwiftUI for the UI elements.

## Conclusion
+ I wish I had more time for the project.
+ I would have allocated more time for UITests and UnitTests.
+ I would have allocated more time for UI design elements.
+ I would have integrated helping library tools like: SwiftLint, SwiftGen, etc
+ I would have allocated more time for error handling/states, and loading states.
+ I loved working again with GraphQL.
+ I choose to use a Modular SwiftUI navigation, which I like sometimes. This is the source of it: https://medium.com/@malousek.jan/modular-swiftui-navigation-part-1-e5c3c7dfd05a
+ Sorry for small mistakes, but I didn't have much time these days
